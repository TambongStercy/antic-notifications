# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a notification service that enables sending messages through WhatsApp and Telegram via API requests. The system will be built using Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and MongoDB, featuring an admin panel for authentication management and service configuration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to send WhatsApp notifications via API requests, so that I can integrate messaging capabilities into my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to `/api/notifications/whatsapp` with valid message data THEN the system SHALL send the message via WhatsApp Web JS
2. WHEN the WhatsApp service is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL return an error indicating authentication is required
3. WHEN the message is successfully sent THEN the system SHALL return a success response with message ID
4. WHEN the message fails to send THEN the system SHALL return an error response with failure reason

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to send Telegram notifications via API requests, so that I can reach users through multiple messaging platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to `/api/notifications/telegram` with valid message data THEN the system SHALL send the message via Telegram Bot API
2. WHEN the Telegram bot is not configured THEN the system SHALL return an error indicating bot setup is required
3. WHEN the message is successfully sent THEN the system SHALL return a success response with message ID
4. WHEN the message fails to send THEN the system SHALL return an error response with failure reason

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to authenticate WhatsApp Web through a QR code interface, so that I can enable WhatsApp messaging capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the admin panel WhatsApp section THEN the system SHALL display the current authentication status
2. WHEN WhatsApp is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL generate and display a QR code for authentication
3. WHEN the QR code is scanned successfully THEN the system SHALL update the authentication status to connected
4. WHEN the WhatsApp session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically generate a new QR code
5. WHEN I click disconnect THEN the system SHALL terminate the WhatsApp session

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure Telegram bot authentication through the admin panel, so that I can enable Telegram messaging capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the admin panel Telegram section THEN the system SHALL display the current bot configuration status
2. WHEN I enter a valid bot token THEN the system SHALL validate and save the token
3. WHEN the bot token is invalid THEN the system SHALL display an error message
4. WHEN the bot is successfully configured THEN the system SHALL display connection status as active
5. WHEN I remove the bot token THEN the system SHALL disable Telegram messaging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to access a secure admin panel, so that I can manage notification service configurations safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the admin panel URL THEN the system SHALL require authentication
2. WHEN I provide valid admin credentials THEN the system SHALL grant access to the dashboard
3. WHEN I provide invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL deny access and display an error
4. WHEN my session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect me to the login page
5. WHEN I logout THEN the system SHALL invalidate my session

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want notification data to be persisted in MongoDB, so that I can track message history and system state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a notification is sent THEN the system SHALL store the message details in MongoDB
2. WHEN authentication states change THEN the system SHALL update the service status in the database
3. WHEN the system starts THEN the system SHALL restore authentication states from the database
4. WHEN querying message history THEN the system SHALL return paginated results from MongoDB
5. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor notification service health, so that I can ensure reliable message delivery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access `/api/health` THEN the system SHALL return service status including WhatsApp and Telegram connectivity
2. WHEN services are operational THEN the health check SHALL return HTTP 200 with service details
3. WHEN any service is down THEN the health check SHALL return HTTP 503 with error details
4. WHEN the database is unreachable THEN the health check SHALL indicate database connectivity issues

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API documentation, so that I can integrate with the notification service effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the API documentation endpoint THEN the system SHALL provide complete endpoint specifications
2. WHEN viewing endpoint documentation THEN the system SHALL include request/response examples
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN the documentation SHALL specify authentication methods
4. WHEN parameters are required THEN the documentation SHALL clearly indicate required vs optional fields
